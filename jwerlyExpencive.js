/*
You go to a jewelry shop and try to find the most expensive piece of jewelry. You write down the name of each piece of jewelry and its price.

Create a function that gets the name of the piece of jewelry with the highest price and returns "The most expensive one is the {name of jewelry piece}".

Examples:
mostExpensive ({
  "Diamond Earrings": 980,
  "Gold Watch": 250,
  "Pearl Necklace": 4650
}) ➞  "The most expensive one is the Pearl Necklace"

mostExpensive({
  "Silver Bracelet": 280,
  "Gemstone Earrings": 180,
  "Diamond Ring": 3500
}) ➞ "The most expensive one is the Diamond Ring"
